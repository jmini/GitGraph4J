== Motivation

Drawing Git Diagram is very important to explain a branching model, or how a tool works, or the required commits during a release process.

Drawing such diagrams manually is really boring.
Especially when you need multiple steps of the same git diagram: you often need to redo the same modifications (like changing a color or a label) on multiple pictures.

The https://www.diagrams.net/[Diagrams.net] (formally Draw.io) project has shared an article about https://www.diagrams.net/blog/gitflow-diagram[how to draw a git flow diagram].

This project automates the creation of such a diagram.
Instead of drawing you defines your commits and the branches you would like to have and you generate the picture.

In addition the tool also supports additional outputs than draw.io.

== Examples pages

Check the xref:examples.adoc[examples page] to see different possibilities and different outputs.

== Usage

The code shared in this project is a prototype more than a real library.

To use it, the best is to have a look at the tests that creates the images in the git-link:src/docs/asciidoc/examples/[examples] folder.

Java code to create a diagram:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::../../test/java/fr/jmini/gitgraph4j/DiagTestUtil.java[tag=createDiagram]

include::../../test/java/fr/jmini/gitgraph4j/AbstractTestCreateDiagram.java[tag=storeFile]
----

=== Drawio

Out of this the tool is computing the drawio source xml which can then be turn into a svg or a png picture:

image:examples/diag06/graph.drawio.png[]

This is the primary target output of the tool.

=== Mermaid JS

Mermaid JS has a module specialized in drawing link:https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/gitgraph[git graphs]. 

The graph corresponding to the previous example would be:

[source, txt]
----
include::examples/diag06/graph.mmd[]
----

Which is rendered like this:

[mermaid]
....
include::examples/diag06/graph.mmd[]
....

Not everything that can be defined in the Java code is properly mapped to the mermaid syntax

=== Dot / Graphviz

The git graph can be turned into a Graphviz file (`*.gv`), written using the DOT description language

The graph corresponding to the previous example would be:

[source, dot]
----
include::examples/diag06/graph.gv[]
----

Which is rendered like this:

[plantuml, format=png]
....
include::examples/diag06/graph.gv[]
....

=== Control commits order

Sometimes you want to control the commits order.
In this case it is better to add the commits directly to the diagram:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::../../test/java/fr/jmini/gitgraph4j/DiagramTest.java[tag=createDiagramInOrder]
----

When the diagram holds all the commits (no other commits added only on one of the contained branches), then no algorithm to sort the commits is applied.

== Download

The code is not hosted on maven central.
If you want to use it, the best option is to clone the repo and to run it locally.

=== Build

This project is using gradle.

Command to build the sources locally:

----
./gradlew build
----

Command to build the documentation page:

----
./gradlew asciidoctor
----

The output of this command is an HTML page located at `<git repo root>/build/docs/html5/index.html`.
